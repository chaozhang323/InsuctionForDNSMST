Some notes for comiling and clean file differnces:

In order to make use of this file you will need to compile with the hdf5_1.10.1
To do this you will first need to make clean the modules folder, 
this programs make file is set to do that with the make command.
Then before remaking change the location of the HDF5 Libary in the makecomm.inc file
to where hdf5_1.10.1 is located. This is currently /share/duan/czb58/Package/HDF5_1.10.1 on the nic cluster.


At this moment file paths are not used so source files should be located in the programs folder
Additionally iConvert_grid is not avalible

imax,  jmax,  kmax
1st, 2nd, and 3rd dimension of the completed file


iConvert_grid, iConvert_flow, iConver_inlet :  0 -- not convert
                                               1 -- convert

iFormat_grid, iFormat_flow   :  1 -- Make VDS file from multiple HDF5 files using kioplane
                                   # kioplane will be used when iFormat = 1
                                2 -- Make VDS file from multiple HDF5 files using inode
                                   # inode will be used when iFormat = 2
                                3 -- Make VDS file from multiple HDF5 files using jnode
                                   # jnode will be used when iFormat = 3


gridfile_rd, gridfile_wt : gridfile path for read and write

flowpath_rd, flowpath_wt : flow path for read and write

file_be, file_end, file_skip: flow file begin, end and skip number
